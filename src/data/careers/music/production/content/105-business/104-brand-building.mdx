# Brand Building

A brand is a name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that distinguishes one seller's good or service from those of other sellers.[2][3][4][5] Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising for recognition and, importantly, to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified, to the benefit of the brand's customers, its owners and shareholders. Brand Names are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands.
