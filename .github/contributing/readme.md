## Thank You

We appreciate you for showing an interest to contribute to CareerGL (Career Guideline), we strongly recommend that you raise an issue to discuss your ideas before adding new Career Guidelines.

Furthermore, Kindly have in mind that our aim is not to have the most extensive list of items but to have the list of guides most relevant today.

Finally, These are *highly opinionated* and *curated*. Your opinion on any resource may not match the view of the curator.

## Steps

- <p><strong>Adding everything available on the internet wouldn't be helpful!</strong><br /> 
  The guidelines represent the modern skillset most valuable in our world, that is, if you were to transit to any of the listed careers, what would you learn?! There might be things that are of course being used but prioritize the things that are most in demand. For instance, agreed people still use newspapers as a medium to market their businesses, however, for effectiveness in today's business world, you would want to consider social media marketing before newspapers. Hence, employ critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff. Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included.</p>

- <p><strong>Only add resources you have evaluated personally!</strong><br /> 
  Provide an honest argument for why the resource should be included. Have you read this book? Can you give a short article?</p>

- <p><strong>One item per Pull Request</strong><br />
  Adding a single item per pull request would make it easier for everyone that will contribute.</p>

- Write meaningful commit messages
- Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones
